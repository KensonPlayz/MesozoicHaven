    We strive to keep our community safe for people of <em>all</em> ages! This means that on <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/live">Kensons Streams</a>, <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/yt">Videos</a>, and anything else, he does not play <strong>any</strong> rated M games, with one exception of an upcoming game (not out yet) called Deathground (Aliens but with dinosaurs basically). At most, he plays <strong>Teen</strong> rated games, as long as there is no unavoidable bad language or certain "references". There is a few exceptions to this as well, like with ARK Survival Evolved, Monster Hunter, and Path of Titans.

<h3>What is the Haven about?</h3> <!-- About Blurb -->
<p>
    In short, the Mesozoic Haven originally started under the name Jurassic Kingdoms. We originally changed our name once Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom came out since we figured it could be hard to get discovered with a big name like what Universal has done to us indirectly. But then I was told by a friend, that we might have been able to still rank for it. Oh well. We do like the name Mesozoic Haven better since it encompasses all the major dinosaur periods, instead of just one (Jurassic).

<p>
    If you want to help contribute to our community expenses, which are currently ~$185 USD/yr (though, we want to run a game server or two!), we'd love any assistance you can! If you are unable to help monetarily, you can simply share our community with your friends to help us out at no cost to you! But if you can help contribute monetarily, here are a few options. You can check out the links below, or browse my Games List & Partner Links.

<h3>Advertise With Us!</h3>
<p>
    If you want to advertise your community with a leaderboard or sidebar ad, please send <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/conversations/add">Kenson a DM</a>. We will need to approve your potential advertisement, before allowing it to be shown to our community! We have a few standards, like no adult content (at all), and preferably a PG-13 rating at most (though we ultimately prefer PG as well, but can make exceptions for some PG-13 sites). <!-- The cost for an advertisement with us is $20/mo for sidebar, and $30/mo for leaderboard (more prime placement), and it will randomly rotate through all advertisers. -->
