<p>Hello! My name is Kenson, and I'm the owner of Mesozoic Haven!</p>
<p>I have been running this community in one form or another since 2015 or so. We started out as Jurassic Kingdoms, but when Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom was released, it tanked our SEO scores (like mentioned on our About page), so we had to come up with a different name. We are still the same community, though!</p>
<p>I am a Non-Swearing (PG) creator who primarily livestreams, and I run the Mesozoic Haven community along with it. You can <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/blog">check out my blog</a>, where I post randomly when I have the time. My primary topic is dinosaur games &amp; entertainment, but I will sometimes post about non-dinosaur stuff, like other franchises I enjoy like <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/index.php?blogs/5-reasons-why-how-to-train-your-dragon-is-an-amazing-movie.5/">How To Train Your Dragon</a>, and other movies. I even wrote about a <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/index.php?blogs/winter-the-dolphin-life-changing-inspiration-to-all.9/">Clearwater Marine Aquarium pendant I enjoy</a>, since it supports the work of the marine hospital at the aquarium!</p>
<p>I am 29 years old, but will be 30 this coming October (2023)! I live in Texas, but have lived in the greater San Diego CA area for a few years, and grew up in the greater Seattle area of Washington State. I have gone to some interesting places in my life, which I will blog about over the course of time. You will most definitely want to keep a passive eye out for my <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/blog/">new blog posts</a> (and <a href="https://mesozoichaven.com/blogs">blogs by other members</a> too)!</p><br>
<h2>Kenson's Early Content Creation History</h2>
<p>I started my content creation "career" back in mid-2014 or so. That's when I created my Twitter and YT channels. But I didn't really start taking it seriously until Mixer was released in mid-2016. I <b>instantly </b>fell in love with the platform and was an active streamer there until the week it died. But, fear not! <a href="https://shareplay.tv/KensonPlays" target="_blank">SharePlay</a> is aiming to be the replacement for Mixer we all want! I was lucky enough to be invited to test their platform a lil while back in their early alpha! I am very impressed by what I'm seeing so far from SharePlay and have high hopes for its future (compared to Glimesh, which was another small streaming platform that tried for Mixer vibes, but development was pretty stagnant in the last half of its life).</p>
<p>I was on Twitch streaming for about 6-9 months until I found Mixer. I instantly jumped ship to Mixer and did not look back until its final month of existence. I knew that Twitch was, unfortunately, the only other real option at the time. Especially since I did not trust Facebook in regard to keeping my IRL data safe from possible hijacking.</p>
